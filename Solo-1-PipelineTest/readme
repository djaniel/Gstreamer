To compile this code on Linux:

gcc -Wall solo-stream.c -o solo-stream $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gstreamer-1.0)

On another terminal gain access to the control app

nc 10.1.1.1 5502

Then run 

./solo-stream

If you want to know how this code works, I'd suggest to read the following webpage:

http://docs.gstreamer.com/display/GstSDK/Basic+tutorials

You may require to install gstreamer1.0 development packages.
